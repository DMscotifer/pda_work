### Revision topics for the Analysis and Design Unit, Level 8, part 1

##### Outcome 1: Describe the use of analysis and design in the software development process

```
1.1 - Describe conventional and contemporary approaches to software development

```

Describe the approaches to software development including: advantages and disadvantages; phases and iteration in the development process; and factors affecting your choice of this approach.

```
1.3 - Describe the Waterfall Development approach

```

Describe the Waterfall Development approach including the production of functional and non-functional requirements specifications.

```
1.4 - Describe the Agile Development approach
```

Select an Agile approach such as Scrum or Kanban, produce an Agile Product Roadmap, use User Stories to capture requirements, produce a Product Backlog, manage and track progress, present results, seek feedback and reflect on future improvements.

#### Identify the characteristics of good program design

You will need to be able to identify different functional and non-functional requirements.

The six main quality characteristics (according to an international standard for evaluating software quality) are:

```
Functionality
Reliability
Usability
Efficiency
Maintainability
Portability
```

This article talks about these characteristics have been looked at in using Ruby:

#### Identify Functional and non functional requirements.

The following article lists some common examples of functional and non-functional requirements.
